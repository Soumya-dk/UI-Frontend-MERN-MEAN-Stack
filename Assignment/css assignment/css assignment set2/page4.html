                    Everything we see around us, right from the moment we step outside our home is part of nature. 
                    The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, trees, breeze, sunlight, everything 
                    that makes our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing are part of nature. 
                </p>

                    According to researchers, nature we see today has developed in 4.5 billion years.
                    Initially, the earth was not sustainable for any kind of living thing.
                    The atmosphere had no to very little oxygen, and the same was the case with water. 
                </p>

                    It is the Mother Nature who never harms us but always nurtures us. 
                    By providing us fruits and vegetables, it nurtures our body. 
                    By providing us water hydrates our body, and by providing oxygen, 
                    it cleanses our body. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is usually seen that people who live close to nature, 
                    especially the villagers live a somewhat happy life as compared to the people living amidst 
                    the high hovering skyscrapers. Nature provides our ears sweet sound of birds, 
                    rejuvenates us with fresh air,breeze fills our soul with joy.

                    Nature has inspired not only poets and writers but also the common man. 
                    All the great poets and writers like William Wordsworth have always given 
                    the nature a significant space in their writings and musings.
