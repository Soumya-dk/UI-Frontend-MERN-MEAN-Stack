                    <p> Everything we see around us, right from the moment we step outside our home is part of nature. 
                        The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, trees, breeze, sunlight, everything 
                        that makes our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing are part of nature. 
                        Nature does not arise spontaneously but needs years and years to bloom and blossom.
